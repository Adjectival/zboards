# Final Fantasy 12 Zodiac Age Job Boards API

## by [Adjectival](alexanderjacks.biz)

Nascent MEAN stack RESTful API project. This means something to modern web developers, b/c we write so much code we start speaking in it, too.

It's an online :cloud: reference :books: for anyone to build applications :iphone: with. Capitalism becomes a gift economy when there's enough free software, ya? :gift:

## Dev Notes
:construction: Under development aka WIP. Check back soon for more functionality.
